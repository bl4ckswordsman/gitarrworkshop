# Anders's Guitarr Workshop
Project work for the course Application Development in Java - DT142G (Mid Sweden University)

## Project Abstract
This project is a website developed in Java to a fictional business owned by a fictional character called Anders. He requires a bespoke web service for his workshop, which specializes in offering repair services and a range of exclusive guitars. The web service is designed to support his business model, focusing on efficient management of appointments, client interactions, and case handling, all organized through an integrated calendar system. This project chronicles the development of the website, a collaborative effort undertaken by our eight-member team, with Java as the chosen programming language. The primary emphasis is placed on the calendar functionality. However, the scope of work extends to include features like database connectivity, enhanced visibility, and practical usability, all developed across three distinct prototypes. The final deliverable is a complete website with a comprehensive, fully functional calendar, alongside robust modules for managing members, cases, and products, and a well-structured admin and client interface, realized through the collective contributions of the entire team.
